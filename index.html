            <h3>About Me</h3>
	        </header>
            <p>After graduating college, I began working with a local nonprofit. I fell in love with working with local communities to acheive positive socio-economic growth and development. It was then that I decided that I would love to start my own nonprofit organization. </p>
            <p>This led me to purchasing a domain to build my own website. However, I quickly realized that I had no idea what I was doing. Thus, I decided to learn how. I am currently a student at Thinkful and have begun the arduous, but rewarding path to becoming a Software Developer. 
            <p>I'm so excited to grow in this journey and to meet other developers along the way!</p>
